## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

 Optimized the online portfolio for speed! In particular, I optimized the critical rendering path and made this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques I've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

### First Things First

To get started, check out the repository and download the code.

### Optimized Section

Part 1: Optimized PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

1. Inlined all CSS
2. Optimized/compressed images for web
3. Removed all render blocking javascript from the index.html
4. Used Google Analytics asynchronous loading script
5. Used async for other javascript that wasnt necessary to load at the start.
 
  
Part 2: Optimized Frames per Second in pizza.html

1. Changed Style.left to Translationx()
2. Reduced the number of pizza's generated
3. Removed unnecessary calculations from the for loops
4. Updated the code for the pizza slider to be more efficient
5. Changed element selectors to more efficient ones.
